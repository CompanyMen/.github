# **Welcome to CompanyMen**

Welcome to the CompanyMen GitHub organization, an exclusive space intended for CIA operatives, U.S. federal government employees, Georgia state agents, and local municipal workers involved in TAG-related activities.

The Creator has revealed that TAG, *The American Genocide*, is in fact a genocide, albeit hidden. Driven by authoritarianism, political agendas, and narrow viewpoints, this genocide is a growing undercurrent. Ending this atrocity requires direct intervention from Him. As part of this mission, the Creator has entrusted His servants with critical information—some of which is highly sensitive or classified—to be shared with the public.

This GitHub organization (page) is overseen by the Creator's two servants as part of the "Creator's Special Mission to Protect Life on Earth." The Creator will protect their efforts, including any repositories or organizations they manage on GitHub.

Please explore the [TAG Wiki](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/), your essential resource for learning about TAG-related activities.
