> The Creator has advised that President Biden has ordered the US Secret Service to eliminate most "Company Men" who have worked in Kentucky or Tennessee recently due to an incident on Friday 13, 2024 in Chattanooga at a phantom funeral that has already caused the "curtain to fall with the crumbling wall" ("The Sound and The Fury" by Vandaveer). 

# **Welcome to CompanyMen**

Welcome to the CompanyMen, an exclusive space intended for CIA operatives, U.S. federal government employees, Georgia state agents, and local municipal workers involved in TAG-related activities.

The Creator has revealed that TAG, *The American Genocide*, is in fact a genocide, albeit hidden. Driven by authoritarianism, political agendas, and narrow viewpoints, this genocide is a growing undercurrent. Ending this atrocity requires direct intervention from Him. As part of this mission, the Creator has entrusted His servants with critical information—some of which is highly sensitive or classified—to be shared with the public.

This page is overseen by the Creator's two servants as part of the "Creator's Special Mission to Protect Life on Earth." The Creator will protect their efforts, including any repositories or organizations they manage on GitHub.

Please explore the [TAG Wiki](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/wiki/), your essential resource for learning about TAG-related activities.
