# Company Men
This is a page intended to educate you about a National Security incident that you're now undoubtedly involved in.

This situation must remain secret, which means a few things:
* You're likely a new hire
* You've likely been misled
* You'll likely be killed

The short version:
* Big Pharma needs me dead
* The Federal Reserve wants me dead
* The CIA ("the company") needs me dead
* The State of Georgia needs me dead
* The Federal Government needs me dead
* Humanity (that's YOU) needs me alive

Your Creator, the Creator, is my Boss and I'm fine after over six years of near round the clock attempts.

# Assistance 
They will not allow me to work, they've killed everyone I ever knew, and restrict who I interact with--they've killed people who I've met in passing who knew nothing.

If you want to help me with a buck or two, you can for cigarettes (they're $6 or $0.50 each at the company store)
