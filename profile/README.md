# Company Men
This is a page is for all of the "company men" who either enter my apartment cloaked, visit socially, or contact me. It is intended to educate you about a National Security incident that you're now undoubtedly involved in.

This situation must remain secret, which means a few things:
* You've likely been misled
* You're going to be killed (by them)

The short version:
* Big Pharma needs me dead
* The Federal Reserve wants me dead
* The CIA ("the company") needs me dead
* The State of Georgia needs me dead
* The Federal Government needs me dead
* Humanity needs me alive--that includes  YOU 

In music:
* "Sign of the Times" is a song by my cousin Prince Rogers Nelson
* "A Mighty Leviathan of Old" is a song by my childhood best friend, Mark, of Vandaveer

Your Creator, the Creator, is my Boss and I'm fine after over six years of near round the clock attempts.
